For the duration of this infusion, anyone who uses the imbued item applies the effect of that metamagic feat to the spell.

Appropriate tools and materials must be provided for the unseen crafter; it makes Craft checks using your ranks in the skill plus your bonus for the relevant spellcasting ability (Intelligence for artificers, wizards, and magewrights, Charisma for bards and sorcerers, and Wisdom for clerics). An unseen crafter can take 10 or attempt to work more quickly (as described in the Craft skill description, page 70 of the Player’s Handbook), but this must be part of the command it is given when the spell is cast. Once the unseen crafter has completed the assigned task, the spell ends as if dismissed. If the unseen crafter leaves work undone, any creature or another unseen crafter can continue it. Special: When the unseen crafter is commanded to repair a warforged, it receives a +10 bonus on its Craft check. *The magewright NPC class is described on page 256 of the EBERRON Campaign Setting.

# Spell Name					Source, Short Desc.	Source Page		Description
Transference.MOD						DESC:Wisps of ethereal light rise off the targeted creatures, consolidate into glowing orbs, and then streak toward the spellcaster, fusing with their body.This spell allows you to store a transfer of XP from one or more creatures (maximum five), but only for the purpose of constructing an agreed upon magic item. The XP gained from other creatures through this spell is not counted toward attaining a new level. Targeted creatures must agree to the focus component that will be used in creating the magic item before allowing this spell to be cast on them. Once the spell is cast, targeted creatures control how much XP to transfer. You cannot accept a transfer of more XP than is needed to construct the agreed upon magic item. All the requirements for transferring XP, compensating for XP, and sharing XP costs apply to the casting of this spell.If allowable changes are made that require more XP, you must provide that XP yourself or cast this spell again to store a transfer of more XP as needed. If allowable changes are made that require less XP, the difference is returned to the targeted creatures in proportionate amounts (as per their original contributions). If you start making a magic item that is not allowed by even one of the targeted creatures, all the transferred XP is immediately returned to those creatures. If you spend at least one day making the agreed upon magic item, the XP is consumed regardless of whether the magic item is completed or not. If you start working on a new magic item after spending at least one day making the agreed upon magic item, the XP is consumed and lost (as per the normal rules for creating magic items).Focus: The raw material of agreed upon magic item (for example, a cloak, sword, or wand).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Acid Rain.MOD							DESC:You create a downpour of acid that douses the area for 1 full round, dealing 7d6 points of acid damage to every creature in the area. The ground within the area becomes muddy and/or slick from the downpour, and remains in that condition for a number of rounds equal to the caster’s class level. Movement in the area is halved, though a creature can move at normal speed by making a DC 10 Balance check. Failure on the check means it cannot move in that round, and failure by 5 or more results in the creature falling prone. Material Component: A flask of acid (cost 10 gp).
